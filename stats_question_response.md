# Stats Question

### Response 

Based on the information currently supplied by the client, we cannot conclude that the new marketing methodology will provide an increase in incremental conversions over the old methodology. In order to conclude whether or not the new marketing methodology will provide an increase in conversion, it will be necessary to conduct a new controlled, randomized experiment, also known as an A/B test. 

A/B testing differs from the approach taken by the client in that it directly compares the performance of A and B - i.e. the new methodology is the "treatment," B, while the old methodology is the "control," A. By contrast, the client's old approach used each marketing approach as is its own treatment compared to its own control, which were essentially two separate tests. 

In a controlled experiment or A/B test, we would once again split users into two groups and half would be treated with the old marketing method as the "control" group, and half would be treated with the new marketing method as the "treatment" group. Designed in this way, it will now be possible to determine which marketing methodology will provide a higher conversion rate. 



### Prompt 

You have a client who is testing out a new marketing methodology. In order to test the new methodology, the client splits their users into two groups. In the first group, some users are treated with the new marketing methodology and others are put into a holdout. In the second group, some users are treated with the old marketing methodology and others are put into a holdout. The client sends you a report on the performance of the two campaigns: (their old methodology vs the new methodology) detailing the overall incremental conversion rate above the holdout of each group as well as "statistical significance" of the incremental conversation rate. "The new methodology shows an incremental conversion rate above its holdout of 3.5% with a statistical significance of 99%. The old methodology shows an incremental conversion rate above its holdout of 2.5% with a statistical significance of 99%". The client asks you if we can conclude whether the new marketing methodology will provide an increase in incremental conversions over the old methodology? This is all of the information you have to work with. You will need to interpret and come up with your conclusions from these two statements.
